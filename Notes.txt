Changes:

- an OWNER can hard stop or hard pass an active poll
- if gatekeep is ENABLED, a gatekeeper must be the last vote on a poll to pass it
- added activePolls array which keeps a library of all active polls.
    - Will be useful for front end
- added advocateFor which maps addresses to an array of polls they have votes for.
- removeAllVotes will iterate through all ACTIVE polls instead of all polls in general.
- Added queryEndTime()
- Added isActive when voters remove votes -> fixes possible exploit
- Removed historicalTally -> unnecessary
- Removed startTime param in polls -> unnecessary
- Starting time will now be set to the time the poll was created
- poll authors must hold a certain number of tokens to create a poll -> minAuthorBal
- Can now track the authors of polls via pollAuthor

Historical Data:
- polls[_pollNum][voter]          // Double Mapping of pollNum to amount of votes per voter
- voterLibrary                    // Mapping of pollNum to array of addresses of voters
- totalVotes                      // Mapping of pollNum to amount of total votes
- pollStartTime                   // Mapping of pollNum to starting timestamp -> start timestamp is always block.timestamp of
                                  //   when poll was created. Could potentially remove this variable
- pollEndTime                     // Mapping of pollNum to ending timestamp
- pollAuthor                      // Mapping of pollNum to address of poll author

Non-Historical Data:
- uint[] activePolls

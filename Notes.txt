Changes:

- an OWNER can hard stop or hard pass an active poll
- if gatekeep is ENABLED, a gatekeeper must be the last vote on a poll to pass it
- added activePolls array which keeps a library of all active polls.
    - Will be useful for front end
- added advocateFor which maps addresses to an array of polls they have votes for.
= removeAllVotes will iterate through all ACTIVE polls instead of all polls in general.

TODO (TESTING):

- Test all new changes
    - gateKeeper and setGateKeeping both onlyOwner and as poll
    - removeVotesFromPoll
    - removeAllVotes
- Test payTeam -> Change .transfer to .call ?
- Test activePolls 
- Possible exploit -> what happens if a poll has passed and someone goes to remove votes
    technically since their votes still exist and there's a balance of tokens, the advocate could remove tokens
- add test with MULTIPLE advocates when poll is passed/ended
- Test migrate Treasury
- Test addVote within 5minute period of purchase of tokens

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO (BUG FIXES / ADDITIONS):

- fix funding / marketing funding / team funding stuff
- Add VIEW function to return proportion of pollNum
- Add revokeAllVotes
- Add list of votes to ongoing polls for each user -> activePolls?
- Add Dao Description
- Add better method for tracking users and their votes
    - As a user I want to see a separate page of polls I have voted for and individually remove my votes If I need to
- Add contract token balance security -> If a vote is added or removed, check contract balance

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes:

- an OWNER can hard stop or hard pass an active poll
- if gatekeep is ENABLED, a gatekeeper must be the last vote on a poll to pass it
- added activePolls array which keeps a library of all active polls.
    - Will be useful for front end
- added advocateFor which maps addresses to an array of polls they have votes for.
- removeAllVotes will iterate through all ACTIVE polls instead of all polls in general.
- Added queryEndTime()
- Added isActive when voters remove votes -> fixes possible exploit
- Removed historicalTally -> unnecessary

Historical Data:
- polls[_pollNum][voter]          // Double Mapping of pollNum to amount of votes per voter
- voterLibrary                    // Mapping of pollNum to array of addresses of voters
- totalVotes                      // Mapping of pollNum to amount of total votes
- pollStartTime                   // Mapping of pollNum to starting timestamp -> start timestamp is always block.timestamp of
                                  //   when poll was created. Could potentially remove this variable
- pollEndTime                     // Mapping of pollNum to ending timestamp

Non-Historical Data:
- uint[] activePolls
